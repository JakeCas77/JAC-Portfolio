Challenge 2
This is my first crack at building a website(from the bottom up). I took what was learned in class,
as well as what I was able to learn off of tutorial videos on youtube.
I played heavily with transition elements, tables and columns in order to have my website
present and unique and modern feel. At some points I felt I bit off more than I can chew since some
elements we have yet to go over in class, so I had no foundation. However, as Mr. Bailey always says
"Try it and see what happens!"
One example of this is the javascript code within the html. I used variables and functions 
in order to be able to shift through the different information presented on the page without
it overlapping into the other(Skills, Experience, Education)
Overall, it was a good experience. Overwhelming at first, but once you see the end product it all pays off
and has you saying "WoW! I did that?"
